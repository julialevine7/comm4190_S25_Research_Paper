# COMM4190 Spring 2025 - AI Potential for Rational Agency in Game Theory

This project addresses the idea of human communication through the cooperation principle via LLM-human conversation. 

Through economic games such as the Prisoners' Dilemma, the extent to which LLMs respond to the cooperation principle will be tested for its applications in more real-life scenarios.

The model tested in this experiment was OpenAI's o1-mini, selected for its advanced reasoning potential. A Prisoners' Dilemma-type game was chosen for its ease of use in a limited conversational setting, however the potential for more multi-stage games in future research could provide additional information on the limitations of LLM cooperation.
